    "\n",
    "Command line and git are very much an [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). You really only need know like 5 or 6 commands off the top of your head for 80% of your functionality, and the rest is not worth storing and is 100% googleable for beginners.\n",

    "GUI - Graphical User Interface - Likely what you are used to on a computer. What we think of when we use an app.\n",

    "\n",

    "#### Looking at the differences between files.\n",
    "1. Save your function from this weekend to a python file (ends with .py) in an empty folder. I'm saving mine as intro.py\n",
    "2. Navigate to your python file using the command line.\n",
    "3. Save a version with -old at the end and take a few lines out. Mine will be intro-old.py\n",
    "4. Use FC or Diff for Windows and Mac/Linux to compare the two files. In my case: Diff intro.py intro-old.py\n",
    "    *This should show you all of the changes you made to your old code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's clone an existing repository, and look at the history\n",
    "1. Open to the [Python Foundations Github Repo](https://github.com/hackoregon/hack-u-py-foundations-sum16) and copy the clone link\n",
    "2. Navigate using the command line where you'd like your new repository to go, and run the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone (paste the git link here)\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. cd into the new directory, and lets look at the revision history. Use the arrow keys to navigate, and q to go back to the command line. Run the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git log\n",

    "4. Git also has a diff. Let's look at the difference between two commits. \n",
    "```\n",
    "git diff (paste commit 1) (paste commit 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If we want to look at previous versions (say we accidentally introduced a bug, and we want to go back before it existed). You can checkout a specific commit from your log.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout (commit id here)\n",
    "git log\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. It's worth noting that any changes you made in a previous version will not be saved unless you create a new branch.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git branch (branch name)\n",
    "git checkout (branch name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "7. To get back to the most recent commit, just check out the branch you want to go to the end of. \n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In our case, I would suggest not committing in this repository since I'll be the only one updating it regularly. If you want to update it with the newest files use the command.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "if that doesn't work try the following. Note that this will erase any changes that you've made that aren't on my repo\n",

    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next let's create our own new repository\n",
    "1. Navigate back to your folder with your python file from before. cd into the folder.\n",
    "2. To start a new repository and start tracking changes, you'll want to use the command\n",
    "```\n",
    "git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. try using ```ls -a``` and it will show you all of the hidden files, including your new .git directory. That's the folder that stores all of your history.\n",
    "4. Run the commands below to find out the \"status\" of your repository. So far we aren't tracking any files, so we'll need to add them.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git log\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. There are 4 buckets your files can be in depending on their status. \n",
    "    * untracked\n",
    "    * tracked - not staged\n",
    "    * tracked - staged\n",
    "    * unchanged (since last commit)\n",
    "    Before you can commit a set of files, you need to stage them.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add (filename)\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. Once you've added all of your files, you'll want to use the command \n",
    "```git commit -m 'your git commit message goes here'\n",
    "```\n",
    "7. Go to github and create a new repository on your profile. Follow the instructions following \"…or push an existing repository from the command line\" **Don't copy/paste this**\n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote add origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git\n",
    "git push -u origin master\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**When to commit?** - Its up to you. Best When you have a working version, or a logical stopping point\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commits track multiple files at once.** If two files are dependent on the other, you wouldn't want to only update one of them per commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "note that it's different from other version control's that we've seen. Google Docs saves automatically, and git you have to save manually? It seems like it'd be nice to have automatic saves, but it makes more sense to save when the author thinks is a significant time.\n",

    "1. Go to a project that you'd like to work on, and fork the repository. In our case our [hack-oregon-trail](https://github.com/rileyrustad/hack-oregon-trail). Now there should be an identical repository in your profile.\n",
    "2. Clone the repository on your profile to your computer\n",
    "7. Let's make a new branch where you'll be editing your files. It's a good habit not to work directly in the master branch, especially when you're collaborating with others.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git branch (name of your branch)\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Check where your repository pushes/pulls from. Try the command below. It should tell you where you pull and push from (should be on your account).\n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Riley will make a change to the online repository. You want that change, but you can only pull from your account, which isn't updated. You'll need to add another \"remote\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "git remote add upstream https://github.com/rileyrustad/hack-oregon-trail.git\n",
    "git remote -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Pull the changes from the updated \"upstream\" master branch. Now the changes should be reflected on your files.\n",
    "``` \n",
    "git pull upstream master\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. Update your \"origin\" master branch on your account by saying git push. Now all repositories should be up to date.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "7. Checkout your branch that you made for your edits. The prompt for your repository should no longer say master, it should use your branch name.\n",
    "```\n",
    "checkout (your branch name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "8. Add your function somewhere in trail.py\n",
    "9. Commit your changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### IN CLASS STOP HERE...\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Now we're going to merge our branches. It's worth noting that git will try to merge things easily for you, and often work out with you needing to resolve anything. We however, do get a conflict because our master branch is one commit ahead of our other branch. Now what? We need to resolve our conflict. ( \n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "git merge (branch name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "11. Open the file where the conflict exists, and you should get a bunch of lines with  >>>>>>>>> ========= -----------. Add or delete code as you see fit to make the version work. then commit your results.\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add trail.py\n",
    "git commit\n",
    "```\n",
    "12. Now push your merged file up to your verion of the repository.\n",
    "13. Then submit a pull request, and leave a message saying what you did."
