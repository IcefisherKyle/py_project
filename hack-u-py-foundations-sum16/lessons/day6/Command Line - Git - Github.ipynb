    "# Command Line Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Command line and git are very much an [80/20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle). You really only need know like 5 or 6 commands off the top of your head for 80% of your functionality, and the rest is not worth storing and is 100% googleable for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "My guide is gleaned from [Learning the Shell](http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php), it's a great guide that goes even deeper if you like this kind of stuff\n",

    "## GUI vs CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "GUI - Graphical User Interface - Likely what you are used to on a computer. What we think of when we use an app.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLI - Command Line Interface - This is maybe what you think of when you look at the matrix.\n",

    "Realistically you can think of it as giving your computer direct commands rather than having a point and click software middleman.\n",

    "Today we'll work with the CLI in either command prompt(windows) or terminal(Linux/OSX)\n",

As you start more projects, you'll want to reorganize your file structure so it doesn't become cluttered. But for now, it's best to keep it accessible to decrease the number of steps it takes to get to your project.\n",

    "### Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a language that is used for version control. The way I like to think about git is thinking back to english class in high school. I would write a rough draft of a paper called paperv1, and every subsequent verion was named paperv2, ...v3, ..v4, etc until vfinal. Generally each version is when I would save too.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of git in a similar way. When we want to take a snapshot of the folder that we are in, we save that verion of the folder. In git we call this special folder a repository and each snapshot is called a commit.\n",
