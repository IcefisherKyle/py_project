    "# Python Problem Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "So you're given a complicated problem, and you don't know where to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the Problem\n",
    "    * Ex. my interview, difference between a palindrome/anagram\n",
    "    * Do you need more domain knowledge? Modeling physics problems?\n",
    "2. Work Example by Hand\n",
    "    * Solve small/simple instance\n",
    "    * If the problem has many steps, solve one at a time\n",
    "    * Generally try 3 examples\n",
    "3. Write down what you did\n",
    "    * Write down the exact steps for just that instance in “pseudocode” or comments\n",
    "        * We as humans have common sense, and often skip steps\n",
    "        * Write down everything, eli5\n",
    "4. Find Patterns(optimize)\n",
    "    * We want an efficient algo for most/all instances of our problem\n",
    "    * Are we repeating ourselves? - can be loops\n",
    "    * Are there conditions? if/else/then - use conditionals\n",
    "    * Values - using same over and over? Using different each time? Carry over from other steps\n",
    "    * Allows us to write less/ more understandable code\n",
    "    * If this is difficult try a different example for steps 1 and 2\n",
    "5. Check By hand\n",
    "    * Follow the path for simple example\n",
    "    * Check for a few inputs\n",
    "6. Translate into code\n",
    "    * Choose your programming language (if you have multiple to choose from)\n",
    "    * Check as you go with print statements, with simple inputs that you had as examples, know what to expect\n",
    "7. Run Test Case\n",
    "    * Did we get the right answer?\n",
    "    * if , yes try a few more ex until confident that it works. Try to think of edge cases\n",
    "    * If no, debug\n",
    "8. Debug Failed tests\n",
    "    * If algo path wrong, go back to step 3\n",
    "    * Using print statements find where things went wrong\n",
    "        * Follow the expected answers until you find something you didn’t expect\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, it's not enough just to read the steps, let's use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use our anagram example from the Practice Exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a Python function called is_anagram to check whether two strings are angrams of one another.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understand the Problem:\n",
    "```What is an anagram?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Anagram - a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's work an example by hand.\n",
    "    * let's use the \"iceman cinema\" example\n",
    "    * let's go through iceman one letter at a time and see take out letters from cinema\n",
    "\n",
    "    * i - cnema\n",
    "    * c - nema\n",
    "    * e - nma\n",
    "    * m - na\n",
    "    * a - n\n",
    "    * n - ...\n",
    "\n",
    "it worked!\n",
    "\n",
    "What about icename and cinema\n",
    "\n",
    "    * i - cnema\n",
    "    * c - nema\n",
    "    * e - nma\n",
    "    * n - ma\n",
    "    * a - m\n",
    "    * m - ...\n",
    "    * e - Uh oh!\n",
    "\n",
    "Didn't work, we need the same number of letters\n",
    "\n",
    "let's try another\n",
    "\n",
    "python and iceman\n",
    "\n",
    "p - ... no p\n",
    "\n",
    "didn't work!\n",
    "\n",
    "ok, now we have sense of what could happen. What did we learn?\n",
    "* we can get a match with an anagram\n",
    "* we can have a word that is a different length, and therefore not an anagram\n",
    "* we can have a word that is the same length but is not an anagram\n",
    "\n",
    "What was our process?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Write down what you did.\n",
    "\n",
    "* are the words the same length?\n",
    "    * if they're not, they're not an anagram\n",
    "* check for the first letter in the first word\n",
    "    * if it's in the second word, take it out\n",
    "    * if it's not in the second word, it's not an anagram\n",
    "* check for the second letter in the first word\n",
    "    * if it's in the second word, take it out\n",
    "    * if it's not in the second letter, it's not an anagram\n",
    "* check for the third letter in the first word...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "* check for the \"n\"th letter in the first word\n",
    "    * if it's in the second word, take it out\n",
    "    * if it's not in the second letter, it's not an anagram\n",
    "* Else - if we made it all the way to the end, and there hasn't been something wrong, **it's an anagram!**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Find Patterns and Optimize\n",
    "Are we reapeating anything? How can we simplify\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we're doing the same steps every time we check each letter. we can iterate over each letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to write the remaining steps in \"pseudo code.\" Basically, writing steps in english, for things we know how to do or how to look up how to do in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "take two inputs word1 and word2\n",
    "if the length of word1 not equal to the length of word2\n",
    "    not an anagram\n",
    "for each letter in word1\n",
    "    if the letter is in word2\n",
    "        take out the letter\n",
    "    elif the letter is not in word2\n",
    "        word2 is not an anagram\n",
    "\n",
    "we've checked all letters in word 1, and there are no mismatches with word2, then it's an anagram!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check By Hand\n",
    "\n",
    "Run through one of our examples where we already know the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Translate what we have now into code\n",
    "No peaking! We'll do this in class! Will post after covered in class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debug Failed tests\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is it good enough?... Or can we do better?\n",
    "(potential step 9)\n"
