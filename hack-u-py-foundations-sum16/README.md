## Aims and Outcomes
1. Feel confident enough to take a more specialized Python Course, and contribute to a Hack Oregon Project.
2. Develop a lifelong love of programming.
3. Feel comfortable putting "[proficient in Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/2fkv4h/when_are_you_considered_proficient_in_python/)" on your CV.
4. Read, understand, and write beautiful Python code.
5. Develop a GitHub Portfolio to show off what you've built.
6. Join the Hack Oregon community of professionals, students, events, and communications that will help your career and the state of Oregon.

## Core Principles
* **Learn by doing** - Project work and getting your hands dirty is essential to you learning to code. Each class period will be split between lecture and projects.
* **Learn from analogies** - Programming concepts can be complicated. Simple relatable examples will help you understand what you need to know
* **Learn to “Fish”** - Our course only lasts 8 weeks, and there’s no way to cover all of Python. I will teach you the skills to continue learning beyond “Python Foundations”
* **80/20** - “80% of the effect is from 20% of the causes” I’ll try to teach you the 20% that will give you 80% of the functionality of Python.

### Who is this course for?
* Beginners who have never programmed
* Programmers coming in from another language or refresh their Python

### Course Communication
The primary platform that we use in Hack University to communicate is Slack. If you haven't been invited to slack yet or want to set it up with another email address, shoot me an email and I'll get you invited. Feel free to check out any of the other channels too. It's a good way to get exposure to new topics and ideas.

### Certificate of Completion
Certificates are distributed via an open sourced badging program, [badgr.io](http://www.badgr.io), which is compliant with [Mozilla Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/) the current industry recognized leader for verifiable digital credentials.

#### Grading Policy
Badges will be issued based upon attendance and participation in class. No more than 3 absences will be allowed, no more than 2 being unexcused. If you must miss class, please contact me, and we'll schedule a time to catch you up.
